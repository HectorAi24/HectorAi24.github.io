## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 11, Part 1 
Although this lab was late into the semester I enjoyed it 
due to the people I was working with. I enjoyed how we object of states to represent 
each states name, population, and land area, And using loops with vectors to find the 
states with the highest and lowest density populations.

Lab 10, Part 1 
This was my second favorite lab as we were asked to organize the 
information into one two dimensional 2D and organized all of California countries by 
alphabet showing their entire population size. This Lab also taught Us how to project and demsontrate modular 
programming where different elements of our program are defined in different files.

Lab 4, Part 2 
I like this lab the most in part 1 and 2 as part one teaches the 
sandwich method and uses a favorite recipe of sandwich making except for tomatoes. For this part we learned how to l write a program that
converts a measurement of volume from milliliters in the metric system, to various units in the US customary system.
While Part 2 deals with blackjack, one of my favorite card games, it goes over the rules 
and each of the different card combinations. For this lab we learned how to use If statement to practice writing code along with 
formating int and if statments.
