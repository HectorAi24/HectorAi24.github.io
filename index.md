 ## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

 Lab 11, Part 1 
 Although this lab was late into the semester I enjoyed it 
 due to the people I was working with. I enjoyed how we object of states to represent 
 each states name, population, and land area, And using loops with vectors to find the 
 states with the highest and lowest density populations.

 Lab 10, Part 1 
 This was my second favorite lab as we were asked to organize the 
 information into one two dimensional 2D and organized all of California countries by 
 alphabet showing their entire population size.

 Lab 4, Part 2 
 I like this lab the most in part 1 and 2 as part one teaches the 
 sandwich method and uses a favorite recipe of sandwich making except for tomatoes. 
 While Part 2 deals with blackjack, one of my favorite card games, it goes over the rules 
 and each of the different card combinations.
